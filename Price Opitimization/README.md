# Product Price Optimization App build with Python & Dash
This is a simulation app which helps businesses to quickly identify the optimal price or a quantity of a given product so that revenue is maximized. The user can set constraints, add additional inputs eg: current cost of production etc on the UI and instantly visualize the trends. The App not only recommends the optimized value but also shows various possible values both visually and also in the tabular form for ease of analysis.
